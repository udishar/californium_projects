          <h2 className='heading'> Master Chef - Shipra Khanna</h2>
           <p className='Para'>Shipra Khanna is an Indian celebrity chef, restaurateur, author and television personality. She is best known for, at the age of 29, winning the second season of the Indian television show MasterChef India which aired on Star Plus.
      Confidently, the young woman presents her tandoori chicken, a classic in her native country. The powerful blend of chili, paprika and turmeric delights the 100 discerning jurors – this is how Indian food is supposed to taste. After a short consultation session and an unbelievably long commercial break, the judgment falls: Masterchef India, a spin-off of the well-known American cooking show, has a new winner! Her competitor offers polite congratulations, though it’s clearly a painful defeat for her. The crowd goes wild; the moderators are practically ecstatic. Only the victor seems calm and collected. Which makes sense, because Masterchef India’s newest winner came to the show with one firm resolution in mind: no more crying.
      hipra Khanna beat out twelve other contestants to win the second season of Masterchef India in 2012. Today, she’s one of the most beloved public figures in the country, and certainly its most popular female TV chef, with numerous cookbooks to her name. Her Instagram account shows that she’s as good with fashion as she is with daal and rice. Hashtag blessed, right? Not always. Khanna’s past was filled with the same suffering that many Indian women experience: she was married at a very young age, and spent years with a husband who was both physically and psychologically abusive.</p>
